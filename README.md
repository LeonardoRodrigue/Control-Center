# Control-Center

It's an application called Control Center that was created by me. This application has games and other additional features, it is a simple but very effective application.

When running the application we will see the program's home screen where we have several functions, such as starting different applications, shutting down, restarting and exiting the machine user and mainly opening other parts of the application.

When starting the applications we have several tools in different forms developed by me, this part serves as a hub that allows you to open different tools and even some mini word guessing games. Among these tools are the mathematical operations calculator, BMI calculator, IPVA calculator, two types of games, one for guessing numbers and another for guessing words and finally a free financial management application.

When the attempts are finished, the user can try again in the same category or join another.
